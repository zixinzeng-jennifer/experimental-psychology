# experimental-psychology
Class project of Experiments in Experimental Psychology.
The experiment was designed by a group of 6 members, but I did all the programming :).
Mainly uses PHP, SQL and Javascript, also uses databases to save experimental data (WAMP environment).
Afterwards, the data was analyzed using SPSS.
